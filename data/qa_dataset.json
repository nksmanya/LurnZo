    "question": "Explain binary search",
    "answer": "Binary search finds a target in a sorted array by repeatedly halving the search space: compare middle, discard the half that cannot contain the target, and repeat. Time complexity is O(log n)."

  {
    "subject": "Computer Science",
    "question": "What is time complexity?",
    "answer": "Time complexity estimates how an algorithm's running time grows with input size. Common classes include O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), and O(n^2)."
